% Baseline Correction with Asymmetric Least Squares Smoothing
% Paul H. C. EilersHans F.M. Boelens, October 21, 2005

% Explanation from the article:
%     Both have to be tuned to the data at hand.
%     We found that generally 0.001 < asym_param < 0.1 is a good choice (for a signal with positive peaks)
%     and 10^2 < smoothness_param < 10^9, but exceptions may occur.
%     In any case one should vary smoothness_param on a grid that is approximately linear for log(smoothness_param).
%     Often visualinspection is sufficient to get good parameter values.
